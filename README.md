# Voice Activity Detector
A simple voice activity detector by neural networks
## Getting started
This is a simple project to carry out the voice activity detector (VAD) task using an architecture of type neural networks. The implementation will be conducted by Python
## Prerequisites
Python librairies need to be installed before the implementation
* Numpy
```
pip install numpy
```
* Scipy
```
pip install scipy
```
* Matplotlib
* Keras
